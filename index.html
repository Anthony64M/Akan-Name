            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a web Application that reveals to you your Akan Name depending on your birthday and your gender. The Akan people of Ghana name their children 
                after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These "day names" has a much deeper meaning, 
                because the day on which a person was born has about the similar significance as in the western hemisphere the assignment to a sign of the zodiac.
                 Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English or Christian name.
                 Notable figures with this names include Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah and former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</p>
